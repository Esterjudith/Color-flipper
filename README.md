#How It's Made:
This is a HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript project. The simple page have a selection of colors only in the indices of 0-3, while the hex page has a selection of colors from any random hex color. In CSS use variables and in JS used Math.random/floor and cute event listener to get the game rolling.
